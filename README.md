# 👋 Hey, I’m Amar

**AI Engineer | Machine Learning • LLM Systems • Applied AI**

I’m a recent AI Engineer focused on building **practical, system-level AI tools** — not just training models, but designing how AI actually *works* in real environments.

My interests sit at the intersection of **Machine Learning, Large Language Models, developer tooling, and AI infrastructure**. I enjoy breaking down complex systems, rebuilding them from first principles, and pushing them a little further than they were meant to go.

Right now, I’m especially interested in **LLM agents, context management, model internals, and tool-augmented reasoning systems**.

## 🔭 What I’m Working On

- **Blonde-Code**  
  A terminal-first AI agent / coding assistant focused on transparency, control, and composability.  
  Built to explore how agents reason, plan, and interact with tools beyond “chat-style” AI.

- **getContext**  
  An experimental **LLM context manager** that treats context like versioned data — inspired by Git.  
  It stores, references, and reconstructs conversational context using encoded nodes and metadata, enabling recursive and conditional context building across sessions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

**Languages**
- Python, JavaScript / TypeScript, C, Java

**Machine Learning & AI**
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn  
- NLP, sentiment analysis, speech & text pipelines  
- Transformer architectures, Whisper-based systems

**LLMs & Agents**
- OpenAI / OpenRouter APIs  
- Tool-augmented agents, prompt & context engineering  
- Custom transformer implementations (from scratch)

**Backend & Systems**
- FastAPI, REST APIs  
- Git-based workflows, Linux-first development  
- Lightweight, resource-aware system design

**Frontend**
- React, Tailwind CSS (learning by building, not memorizing)

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Designing **LLM systems**, not just prompts  
- Understanding **model internals & failure modes**
- Building **agent architectures** that scale beyond demos  
- Improving context, memory, and reasoning in AI tools

---

## 🌱 Always Learning

I actively keep up with:
- New LLM architectures & research
- Agent frameworks and RLM-style systems
- AI tooling, infra, and developer experience

If something feels like “magic,” I want to know **why** it works — and where it breaks.
